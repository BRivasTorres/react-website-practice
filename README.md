# React Website Practie

This repository was created to maintain an itinerary of practices made from some real sites.  
These practices have helped me a lot to reinforce, improve and learn concepts. Since by representing parts of real pages, advanced functionalities are implemented, such as login, authentications, subroutes, dynamic routes, etc.
